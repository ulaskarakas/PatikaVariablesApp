## Code Explanations
- **Variables**: User input is stored as strings since no arithmetic operations are performed on them.
- **TryParse Usage**: Product prices are taken as strings and converted to integers using the `int.TryParse` method.
- **Conditional Loop**: Ensures the user enters a valid number; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
- **Point Calculation**: 10% of the total expenditure is calculated as "Patika Puan".
